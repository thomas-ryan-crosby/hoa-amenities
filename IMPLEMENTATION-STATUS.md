## üìä **PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Phase 1: Critical for Launch (Do First)**
1. **Payment Processing (Square Integration)**
   - Without payment, the system is not fully functional
   - Users expect to pay fees/deposits online
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 days

2. **Email Notification System (Reservation-related)**
   - Essential for user communication
   - Improves user experience significantly
   - Estimated effort: 1-2 days

### **Phase 2: Important Features (Do Next)**
3. **Party Completion & Damage Assessment Workflow**
   - Janitorial marks party complete
   - Janitorial assesses damages (if any)
   - Admin reviews/approves/adjusts/denies assessment
   - Charge damage fee via Square if approved/adjusted
   - No upfront deposit - only charge if damages occur
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 days (includes UI updates for payment model)

### **Phase 3: Nice to Have (Optional)**
5. Reminder System
6. Reporting & Analytics
7. Advanced Cancellation Policies
