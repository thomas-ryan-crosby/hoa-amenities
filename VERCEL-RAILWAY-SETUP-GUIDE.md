   - Look for variables that start with `PG` (these are from your Postgres service)
   - You should see:
     - `PGHOST`
     - `PGPORT`
     - `PGDATABASE`
     - `PGUSER`
     - `PGPASSWORD`
   
3. **Map Postgres Variables to Backend Variables**
   - Your backend code expects different variable names
   - Add these new variables (click "+ New Variable" for each):
   
   **Variable 1:**
   - **Name:** `DB_HOST`
   - **Value:** Copy the value from `PGHOST` variable (or use: `postgres.railway.internal`)

## **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Issue: Vercel Frontend Still Shows localhost:5000**

**Solution:**
1. Double-check `REACT_APP_API_URL` is set in Vercel
2. Make sure you redeployed AFTER adding the variable
3. Clear browser cache completely
4. Try incognito/private browsing mode

---

### **Issue: Railway Backend Keeps Crashing**

**Solution:**
1. Check logs for specific error
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Make sure Root Directory is `backend`
4. Check that database variables match your Postgres service
5. Make sure `DB_PASSWORD` matches `PGPASSWORD`

---

### **Issue: CORS Errors in Browser**

**Solution:**
1. Check Railway backend logs for CORS errors
2. Verify `FRONTEND_URL` in Railway is set to `https://www.neighbri.com`
