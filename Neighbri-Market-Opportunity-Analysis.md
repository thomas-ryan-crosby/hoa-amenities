# Neighbri Market Opportunity – TAM / SAM / SOM Analysis

## 1. Overview

Neighbri is a marketplace + infrastructure layer enabling day passes and micro-memberships into non-hospitality amenities such as:

- Community pools
- Clubrooms
- Gyms & fitness centers
- Tennis courts / pickleball courts
- Other HOA & multifamily common areas

This analysis sizes the U.S. market for non-resident amenity access, similar to how ResortPass sized hotel day-pass markets.

## 2. National Asset Universe (Supply Side)

### 2.1 HOAs, Condos & Community Associations

- ~370,000 community associations in the U.S.¹
- Managing ~40M homes & ~75M residents²
- Collect $120.9B in annual assessments³
- HOA fees typically $135–300+ / month⁴

These fees fund amenities like pools, gyms, clubhouses, and courts.

**Assumption A1:**
- ~60% of HOAs have a Neighbri-eligible amenity.
- **Amenity-rich HOAs ≈ 370,000 × 60% ≈ 220,000 communities**

### 2.2 Multifamily (Apartments & Rental Communities)

- 21–23 million apartment homes in the U.S.⁵
- Multifamily = ~30% of U.S. housing stock⁶
- ~600,000 new units delivered in 2024, most in amenity-rich 50+ unit buildings⁷

**Assumption A2:**
- Total apartment properties ≈ 210,000, of which ~60% have shared amenities.
- **Amenity-rich multifamily ≈ 210,000 × 60% ≈ 125,000 communities**

### 2.3 Neighbri Total Amenity-Enabled Property Base

| Segment | Amenity-Rich Communities |
|---------|-------------------------|
| HOAs / Condos | ~220,000 |
| Multifamily | ~125,000 |
| **Total** | **~345,000 communities** |

This forms the supply-side basis of Neighbri's TAM.

## 3. Market Validation (Demand Side)

This model has strong proof: consumers already pay for access to local amenities.

### 3.1 Swimply (Private Pools & Courts)

- Host supply grew from **7,000 → 15,000+**⁸
- 2M+ projected users this year⁹
- Top hosts earn $160k+ per year¹⁰

### 3.2 Court Rentals (Pickleball, Tennis, etc.)

- Racquet facility rental market: $15.2B (2024)¹¹
- Pickleball reservations market: $420M → $1.6B by 2033¹²

**Conclusion:**
People already pay for local, time-sliced access to swimming, fitness, and courts.

Neighbri enables this behavior for HOAs and multifamily.

## 4. TAM – Total Addressable Market

**Definition:**
Total annual dollars spent nationwide on non-resident access to HOA and multifamily amenities in a mature market.

### 4.1 Annual GTV Per Community

Conservative vs. aggressive assumptions:

| Scenario | Annual GTV per Community |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Low | $20,000 |
| Mid | $40,000 |
| High | $60,000 |

### 4.2 Multiply by ~345k Amenity-Rich Communities

| Scenario | TAM (Annual GTV) |
|----------|-----------------|
| Low | $7B |
| Mid | $14B |
| High | $21B |

### 4.3 Platform Revenue TAM

Assuming 20% take rate:

$14B × 20% = $2.8B/year (mid-case)

**TAM Summary:**
- Neighbri TAM = $7–21B GTV → ~$2.8B platform revenue (mid-case)

## 5. SAM – Serviceable Available Market

**Definition:**
The portion of TAM accessible in 7–10 years, starting with large metros and professionally managed assets.

### 5.1 Focus on Top 50 MSAs

Assume 50% of amenity-rich communities are in these high-value areas.

**SAM Properties = ~170,000 communities**

### 5.2 Apply Mid-Case GTV

170,000 × $40,000 ≈ $7B annual GTV

### 5.3 Platform Revenue SAM

20% take rate → $1.4B annual revenue

**SAM Summary:**
- $7B GTV → ~$1.4B platform revenue

## 6. SOM – Serviceable Obtainable Market

**Definition:**
The slice Neighbri can realistically capture in 5–7 years.

**Given:**
- No dominant competitor
- Extreme fragmentation (HOAs)
- Strong consumer validation

A 5–10% SOM is achievable.

### 6.1 SOM Calculations

| Share | Annual GTV | Platform Revenue (20%) |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|
| 5% | ~$0.35B | $70M |
| 10% | ~$0.7B | $140M |

**SOM Summary:**
- $70–140M annual platform revenue within 5–7 years (U.S. only)

## 7. Overall Summary (Deck-Ready)

### TAM – Long-Run Full U.S. Opportunity
- 345,000 amenity-rich communities
- $7–21B annual GTV
- $2.8B mid-case platform revenue opportunity

### SAM – Priority U.S. Metros
- 170,000 communities
- $7B annual GTV
- $1.4B platform revenue

### SOM – Neighbri's Realistic Capture
- $0.35–0.7B annual GTV
- $70–140M annual platform revenue

**Positioning Statement:**
Neighbri unlocks a new category of revenue across 345,000+ residential communities.

Consumers already pay billions for local access to pools, courts, and fitness spaces.

Neighbri standardizes, regulates, and monetizes this demand for HOAs & multifamily.
