# Beta Testing Invitation Email

**Subject:** Help Us Test Neighbri - Beta Testing Invitation 🎉

---

Hi [Friend/Family Name],

I hope this email finds you well! I'm reaching out because I'd love your help testing **Neighbri**, a new platform I've been building for HOA/community amenity management.

## What is Neighbri?

Neighbri is a web application that helps HOAs and communities manage their amenities (pools, clubrooms, tennis courts, etc.). It allows residents to make reservations, staff to approve them, and admins to manage everything.

## Why Your Help Matters

This is **beta software**, which means it's functional but still being refined. Your fresh eyes and honest feedback will be incredibly valuable in helping me identify:
- Bugs and issues
- Confusing user interfaces
- Missing features
- Design improvements
- Overall user experience

## What I'm Asking

I'd love for you to spend **1-2 hours** (or test at your own pace!) exploring the platform and providing feedback. You can:
- Follow the test plan I've created (it's a guide, not a strict script)
- Go off script and explore freely
- Try to break things (seriously, we want to know what breaks!)
- Test on different browsers or devices if possible

## How to Get Started

1. **Visit the Test Plan**: https://www.neighbri.com/testplan
   - This page has all the testing scenarios and instructions
   - You can also view the full detailed plan on GitHub if you want more specifics

2. **Start Testing**: 
   - **Step 1 - Create a New Community**: Use your first email address to create a new community (you'll become the admin)
   - **Step 2 - Register for The Sanctuary**: Use your second email address to register for "The Sanctuary" community
     - Search for zip code `70471` to find The Sanctuary
     - Complete registration with your second email
   - **Step 3 - Test Different Roles**: Use these test accounts to experience different perspectives:
     - **Admin**: `ryan@kellby.com` | `admin123`
     - **Janitorial**: `janitorial@hoa.com` | `admin123`
     - **Resident**: Your second email (the one you used to register for The Sanctuary) OR `resident@hoa.com` | `admin123`

3. **Provide Feedback**:
   - **Screen Recording**: Record your testing session (narrate what you're thinking!)
   - **Written Document**: Create notes with screenshots and observations
   - **Email**: Send detailed feedback directly
   - **Mix of Methods**: Use whatever works best for you!

## What Kind of Feedback?

**Everything!** We want to hear about:
- Bugs and technical issues
- Confusing or unclear features
- Design and visual feedback (colors, fonts, spacing, layout)
- Feature suggestions
- Overall impressions and user experience
- Anything else you notice!

## Important Notes

- This is **beta software** - some things may not work perfectly
- The test plan is a **guide, not a script** - feel free to explore freely
- Your feedback can be as detailed or as brief as you like
- There are no wrong answers - your honest opinion is what we need

## Timeline

There's no strict deadline, but if you could provide feedback within the next **2-3 weeks**, that would be amazing. Test at your own pace!

## Questions?

If you have any questions or run into issues while testing, please don't hesitate to reach out:
- **Email**: [Your email]
- **Phone**: [Your phone number]

## Thank You!

I really appreciate you taking the time to help test Neighbri. Your feedback will directly shape how the platform evolves, and I'm genuinely excited to hear what you think!

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best,
[Your Name]
