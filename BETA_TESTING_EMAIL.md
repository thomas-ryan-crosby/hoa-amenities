# Beta Testing Invitation Email

**Subject:** Help Us Test Neighbri - Beta Testing Invitation 🎉

---

Hi [Friend/Family Name],

I hope this email finds you well! I'm reaching out because I'd love your help testing **Neighbri**, a new platform I've been building for HOA/community amenity management.

## What is Neighbri?

Neighbri is a web application that helps HOAs and communities manage their amenities (pools, clubrooms, tennis courts, etc.). It allows residents to make reservations, staff to approve them, and admins to manage everything.

## What I'm Asking

I'd love for you to spend **1-2 hours** (or test at your own pace!) exploring the platform and providing feedback. This is **beta software**, so your fresh eyes and honest feedback are invaluable.

## How to Get Started

1. **Visit the Test Plan**: https://www.neighbri.com/testplan
   - All detailed testing scenarios and step-by-step instructions are here

2. **Quick Overview**:
   - You'll need **two email addresses** (one to create a new community, one to register for "The Sanctuary")
   - Search for zip code `70471` to find The Sanctuary
   - Test accounts are provided for admin, janitorial, and resident roles

3. **Provide Feedback**:
   - Screen recording, written document, or email - whatever works best for you!
   - We want to hear about bugs, confusing features, design feedback, and anything else you notice

## Questions?

- **Email**: thomas.ryan.crosby@gmail.com or neighbriapp@gmail.com
- **Phone**: 985-373-2383

## Thank You!

Your feedback will directly shape how the platform evolves. I'm genuinely excited to hear what you think!

Best,
Thomas
